README policyd-spf-fs
----------------------

This is a policy daemon for checking SPF records in postfix. It is based on
the spfquery command line tool from libspf2.

Requirements
------------
libspf2 >= 1.2.5

Compilation
-----------
Should be straight forward, just type "make"

With "make install" the policy daemon will be installed in /usr/local/sbin

Installation
------------

Add the following to master.cf

# Policy daemon for SPF
spf-policy  unix  -       n       n       -       -       spawn
        user=nobody argv=/usr/local/sbin/policyd-spf-fs --debug=1


And this to main.cf

smtpd_sender_restrictions =
   your policy here
   ...
   reject_unknown_sender_domain
   reject_unverified_sender
   check_policy_service unix:private/spf-policy

Be sure to have SPF after reject_unverified_sender else you will probably
get an open relay!

Tuning
------

Under high load it is important, that the maxproc parameter (the last before
spawn) matches the amount of smtpd which can make requests the the policyd,
else you will get service unavailable in your log.
